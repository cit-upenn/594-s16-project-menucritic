The earliest reference to Shrimp Scampi in the New York Times is a restaurant advertisement published in 1956 for the Tenakill Restaurant in Englewood, N.J. There are many variations of Shrimp Scampi.\u00a0 Our version consists of five Jumbo Shrimp saut\u00e9ed in butter with fresh garlic, lemon juice, white wine and chopped parsley."
